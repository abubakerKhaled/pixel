[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually
       rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to
       internals.

       See [1mgittutorial[22m(7) to get started, then see [1mgiteveryday[22m(7) for a useful minimum
       set of commands. The [34m[1mGit User’s Manual[0m[1m[22m[1] has a more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn
       what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with
       "git help command". [1mgitcli[22m(7) manual page gives you an overview of the
       command-line command syntax.

       A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be viewed
       at [34m[1mhttps://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html [0m[1m[22mor [34m[1mhttps://git-scm.com/docs[0m[1m[22m.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       -v, --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the [4mgit[24m program came from.

           This option is internally converted to [1mgit version ...  [22mand accepts the
           same options as the [1mgit-version[22m(1) command. If [1m--help [22mis also given, it
           takes precedence over [1m--version[22m.

       -h, --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the
           option [1m--all [22mor [1m-a [22mis given then all available commands are printed. If a
           Git command is named this option will bring up the manual page for that
           command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed.
           See [1mgit-help[22m(1) for more information, because [1mgit --help ...  [22mis converted
           internally into [1mgit help ...[22m.

       -C <path>
           Run as if git was started in [4m<path>[24m instead of the current working
           directory. When multiple [1m-C [22moptions are given, each subsequent non-absolute
           [1m-C <path> [22mis interpreted relative to the preceding [1m-C <path>[22m. If [4m<path>[24m is
           present but empty, e.g.  [1m-C ""[22m, then the current working directory is left
           unchanged.

           This option affects options that expect path name like [1m--git-dir [22mand
           [1m--work-tree [22min that their interpretations of the path names would be made
           relative to the working directory caused by the [1m-C [22moption. For example the
           following invocations are equivalent:

               git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
               git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will
           override values from configuration files. The <name> is expected in the
           same format as listed by [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m (subkeys separated by dots).

           Note that omitting the [1m= [22min [1mgit -c foo.bar ...  [22mis allowed and sets [1mfoo.bar[0m
           to the boolean true value (just like [1m[foo]bar [22mwould in a config file).
           Including the equals but with an empty value (like [1mgit -c foo.bar= ...[22m)
           sets [1mfoo.bar [22mto the empty string which [1mgit config --type=bool [22mwill convert
           to [1mfalse[22m.

       --config-env=<name>=<envvar>
           Like [1m-c <name>=<value>[22m, give configuration variable [4m<nam
